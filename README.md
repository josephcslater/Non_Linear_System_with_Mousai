# Non-Linear System Solved with Mousai
Non-similar non-linear normal mode with non-symetric grounding stiffness equations of motion, using harmonic-balance method in Mousai.
Mousai is written by Dr. Joesph Slater, https://github.com/josephcslater/mousai.git, and equations tested from Non-Linear Normal Modes (NNM) and There Applications in Vibration Theory: an Overview by A.F. Vakakis, https://www.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01354037/document.
