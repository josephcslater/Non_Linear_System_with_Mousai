# Non-Linear System Solved with Mousai
Non-similar non-linear normal mode with non-symetric grounding stiffness equations of motion, using harmonic-balance method in Mousai.
Mousai is written by Dr. Joesph Slater and equations tested from Non-Linear Normal Modes (NNM) and There Applications in Vibration Theory: an Overview by A.F. Vakakis.
